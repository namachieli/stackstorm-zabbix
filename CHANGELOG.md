# Change Log

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-05

**BREAKING CHANGE**: This version is not backwards compatible with previous releases. All actions have been renamed, parameters standardized, and return types changed. Existing workflows, rules, and automations that reference this pack must be refactored before upgrading.

### Added
- Zabbix 6.0.46 API compatibility
- StackStorm 3.9 compatibility
- Webhook media type for direct StackStorm API integration (replaces script-based approach)
- Webhook media type for RabbitMQ message publishing
- API token authentication support (in addition to user/password)
- `scripts/register_webhook_st2.sh` for automated ST2 webhook configuration
- `scripts/register_webhook_rabbitmq.sh` for automated RabbitMQ webhook + exchange/queue configuration
- 139 actions covering the full Zabbix 6.0 API (up from 25)
- `call_api.py` generic dispatcher handles ~130 YAML-only actions via `api_method` + `params_list`
- `find_object.py` generic name→ID resolver for 7 find actions (host, hosts, hostgroup, template, proxy, maintenance, script)
- `acknowledge_event.py` dedicated action for event acknowledgement with close support
- `host_status.py` consolidated get/update host status by hostname
- Full CRUD coverage for: hosts, hostgroups, templates, items, triggers, maintenance, proxies, scripts, services, SLA, users, usergroups, roles, media types, discovery, host interfaces, graphs, value maps, web monitoring, correlations, API tokens, maps, dashboards, actions/alerting, user macros (host + global)
- `list.problems` action (most important monitoring action)
- `export.configuration` and `import.configuration` actions
- `execute.script` action for remote script execution
- `host_get_extended()` helper method in ZabbixBaseAction (DRY refactoring)
- `conftest.py` for pytest path configuration
- Enriched trigger payload schema with structured Zabbix event fields
- Contributors field in pack.yaml
- `actions/README.md` design guide documenting conventions and patterns
- `tests/README.md` guide for test structure and contribution
- 56 unit tests passing

### Changed
- Switched from py-zabbix (EncoreTechnologies fork) to official `zabbix-utils` library
- All actions now use pack config auth exclusively (removed per-action token parameter)
- All actions renamed to `<verb>.<object>[.<qualifier>]` dot-delimited convention
- Standardized return patterns: return data directly on success, raise exceptions on failure (no more tuple returns)
- Standardized parameter naming: `hostname` (name string), `host_id` (single ID), `host_ids` (array)
- Consolidated 17 Python entry points down to 10 via DRY refactoring
- `call_api.py` enhanced with `params_list` support for positional-arg API methods (delete operations)
- `create_host.py` simplified — no tuple returns, raises ValueError on error
- `host_delete.py` parameter renamed `host` → `hostname`
- `maintenance_create_or_update.py` uses `.timestamp()` instead of `strftime('%s')`, returns ID directly
- config.schema.yaml simplified to Zabbix-only auth
- `docker-compose.yaml`: pinned images to `6.0-ubuntu-latest`, mysql to `8.0`
- Overhauled README.md with complete documentation

### Removed
- `tools/` directory (register_st2_config_to_zabbix.py, st2_dispatch.py)
- `spec/` directory (Ruby Serverspec tests)
- `Gemfile` and `Rakefile` (Ruby infrastructure)
- `images/` directory (legacy screenshots)
- Legacy script-based media type approach
- `six` library dependency
- `pytz` dependency
- Legacy `token` parameter from 9 action YAML definitions
- `rules/zabbix_rabbitmq_bridge.yaml` (unnecessary bridge rule)
- `actions/register_webhook_st2.py` + `.yaml` (scripts are the correct mechanism)
- `actions/register_webhook_rabbitmq.py` + `.yaml` (scripts are the correct mechanism)
- `test_tool_register_st2_config_to_zabbix.py`
- `test_tool_st2_dispatch.py`
- `extra_args` field from trigger payload schema
- All 25 legacy action files (replaced by 139 consistently-named actions)
- `event_action_runner.py` (replaced by `acknowledge_event.py`)
- `host_get_id.py`, `host_get_multiple_ids.py` (replaced by `find_object.py`)
- `host_get_status.py`, `host_update_status.py` (replaced by `host_status.py`)
- `host_get_interfaces.py`, `host_get_inventory.py`, `host_get_hostgroups.py` (replaced by YAML-only actions via `call_api.py`)
- `list_media_types.py` (replaced by YAML-only action via `call_api.py`)
- `ACTIONS-PROPOSAL.md` (design decisions captured in `actions/README.md`)

### Added
- `actions/host_get_interfaces.yaml` - Gets the interfaces of one or more Zabbix Hosts

### Updated
- `actions/update_host.yaml` - Added some of the default host properties from the following link to allow them to be changed as well
  https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/5.0/manual/api/reference/host/object

## 0.3.2

- Extend `list_hosts` action to allow specifying a list of groupids (not possible in `filter`), as well as `output` to allow trimming of returned data.

## 0.3.1

### Added

- Explicitly specify supported Python versions

### Changed

- Fixups for Python 3

## 0.3.0

### Added

- `actions/call_api.py` - A primitive pimplemenetation of `python-script` to send a request to specified API endpoint with other specified parameters.
- `actions/list_host_groups.yaml` - List all host_groups objects which are registered in Zabbix
- `actions/list_host_interfaces.yaml` - List all hostinterfaces objects which are registered in Zabbix
- `actions/list_hosts.yaml` - List all host objects which are registered in Zabbix
- `actions/list_templates.yaml` - List all templates objects which are registered in Zabbix
- `actions/update_host.yaml` - A primitive action to update host information

## 0.2.0

### Added

- `actions/create_host.yaml` - register a new host object to zabbix server.

## 0.1.11

### Changes

- `triggers/event_handler.yaml` - `alert_message` type updated to include `array`, `object`
  with logic in `st2_dispatch.py` to handle the difference.
- `st2_dispatch.py` flags: `--st2-api-url` and `--st2-auth-url` no longer have default values.
  See code comments for details.

### Additions

- API Keys can now be used to authenticate to the ST2 API. Please see the 'Advanced Usage'
  section in the readme for more details.
- `--api-key` flag can be passed to `st2_dispatch.py` to test usage with an API Key for authentication
- `st2_dispatch.py` can now send to a user defined trigger, but defaults to `zabbix.event_handler`
- The value of `alert_message` passed in from the Zabbix macro `{ALERT.MESSAGE}` will now be evaluated
  to determine if its a JSON valid List or Dict, or a string, and passed accordingly.
- When using a JSON Dict to pass auth parameters, keys and values passed are parsed as is into options
  that can then be used in later logic.
  This means you can pass any valid option as a key:val pair (`st2_userid`, `st2_passwd`, `trigger`, etc)
  - This excludes `alert_sendto`, `alert_subject`, `alert_message` as they are parsed after the JSON Dict

### Fixes

- Corrected a bug in `ack_event.yaml` where `enum:` was applied with `type: boolean`. Fixes #32
- `host_get_multiple_ids` - `type:` is now `array` (was `string`). Fixes #22

## 0.1.10

- The script that registers st2's configuration to Zabbix would be compatible with Zabbix v4.0.
- An integration test for `register_st2_config_to_zabbix.py` with different version of Zabbix was added.
- A configuration file of docker-compose was added for running integration test in local machine.

## 0.1.9

- Version bump to fix tagging issue. No code change

## 0.1.8

### Added

- New Action: `host_get_inventory` - Get the inventory of one or more Zabbix Hosts

## 0.1.7

### Changed

- Changed MediaType parameter of StackStorm to access through the API endpoints instead of accessing
  directly to each service processes.
- Changed `st2_dispatch.py` to conform to be able to communicate with up to date st2api (v2.8).

  **Note:** This change is backward incompatible -- the interface of `st2_dispatch.py` is changed from
  `--st2-host` to `--st2-api-url` and `--st2-auth-url` to be able to dispach trigger through proxy.
  To update from previous version to this, you should execute `register_st2_config_to_zabbix.py` command.
  This resets configuration of Zabbix for conforming to the interface of current `st2_dispatch.py`
  to dispatch `zabbix.event_handler`.

### Fixed

- Fixed typos in README and ported images from persoanl repository of a contributor
- Fixed to be able to overwrite Zabbix configuration for StackStorm by `register_st2_config_to_zabbix.py`


## 0.1.6

## 0.1.5

- Added a new action `host_get_multiple_ids` that can retrieve 0, a single, or multiple zabbix hosts and
  return those as an array. This is for a race condition that exists when using several zabbix proxies.
- Added a new action `host_delete_by_id` that allows a host to be deleted given the Host's ID instead of
  the Host's Name
